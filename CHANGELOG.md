- When you update an existing stack from v0.1.x to v0.2.x the existing admin user is recreated. You are emailed a temporary password and must set a new permanent password as you did when you first deployed the stack. See [User Based Access Control (Preview)](./lma-ai-stack/README_UBAC.md) for more information, and recommendations on how to differentiate the admin username/email from a non-admin username/email (e.g joe+admin@acme.com vs joe@acme.com) if you are configuring LMA for multiple users.
